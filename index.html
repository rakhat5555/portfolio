<h3>About Me<h3/>
 <p>I am Rakhat. I live in Portland Oregon for 4 years. I'm from Kyrgyzstan. My country is very similar to Oregon, beautiful. In my free time I like to spend time with people close to me. We love to play board games. When the weather is good we love to go out into nature. I also play the cello. For more than 10 years I worked as a teacher in a music school. At the moment I am very interested  front end development and in the future I would like to see myself in this area
